    The Song I Play
    </div>
    <p>
        My life is a verse, wondering if I’ll get to the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>    
        I’m in the continuous rhythm that never changing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope to break free from the notes that are being played
    </p>
    <p>
        As I cross the bridge I feel free and hope not to falter, but go back to the rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Will I ever play a new song in my life?
    </p>
    <p>
        This I hope and will achieve.
    </p>
